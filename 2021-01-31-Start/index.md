# Where To Start

I've spent most of my career on the blue team side of things, with some forays into the red team side of things as needed, when able to convince management things need to be tested, in classes, and the occassional contracting. With that in mind, I've started working on HackTheBox to get more practice, and learn as I go. I've signed up for a few courses as well. So, here goes my educational journey.

I plan to post write-ups for boxes as I work through them, so that others can reference them for help. I will try to include screenshots, my process, thoughts, etc. as I go. So, enjoy the ride.
